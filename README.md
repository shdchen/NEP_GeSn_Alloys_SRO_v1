# Neuroevolution machine learning potentials (NEP MLPs) for accurately and efficiently sampling short-range order (SRO) of GeSn alloys using large-scale atomistic simulations

## Two NEP MLPs for GeSn alloys trained based on different training datasets

* **`NEP_MLP_GeSn_Full_V1.txt`** is a NEP MLP trained based on a training dataset comprising 276009 structures (17664576 atoms), 90% of a ***full*** training dataset of 306677 structures (19627328 atoms).

* **`NEP_MLP_GeSn_Active_V1.txt`** is a NEP MLP trained based on a ***active learning*** training dataset comprising 137 structures (8768 atoms).
